An Experiment about Factors Involved in a Catapult Design
Abstract
The present study experimented with physics and math involved in catapults by
building and analyzing a Mangonel Catapult of volume 21000cm3. The Literature Review
discusses different designs that may qualify as a Mangonel Catapult. Also, the energy
transformed during a projectile motion and the tension applied by rubber bands were
investigated so that the projectile achieves a long distance after launch. Moreover, different
attempts were made to analyze the most efficient launching angle, which led to the
conclusion that when the launch is made from 70°, the distance traveled can be maximized.
Furthermore, the projectile's initial velocity, which is the same as the arm's final velocity,
must be high, considering inertia, so that the objectives regarding distance traveled can be
achieved. This requirement could be met through high tension applied by rubber bands and
an optimal draw-back angle of the arm. Overall, this process was crucial for the authors to
reflect on topics such as circular motion, projectile motion, and energy transformation in reallife situations.

Introduction
The usage of catapults has had a significant change in the past centuries. Catapults
were first used by the Greek people during the 3rd century before Christ to fire missiles at
castles and conquer land (Chakraborti and Chakrabarti, 2022). Since then, catapults have
been replaced by modern technology, but they are still used by engineers to study forces,
energy transformation, and projectile motion (Güner, T., 2013). This report aims to analyze
the physics and math involved in a catapult and translate these aspects into a popsicle stick
model. Through this analysis, the chosen design of the catapult will allow the Malteser to
travel an average horizontal distance of 4.95m by maximizing the initial velocity. This will be
possible by applying a force of 8.87N on the arm, launching at an angle of 70°, and drawing
back the arm by 125°. In summary, the force applied to the catapult, the drawback and
launching angle, and the initial velocity will directly impact the total distance traveled by the
projectile.
Literature Review
In general, the engineering involved in catapults includes tension, torsion, and
gravity, which are used differently to launch projectiles. Some types of catapults are
Trebuchet, Ballista, and Mangonel (Chakraborti and Chakrabarti, 2022). Concerning
Mangonel catapults, there are conflicts between researchers regarding what qualifies a
catapult as a Mangonel. Hassaan’s (2014) study claims that a Mangonel is an Arabic
Trebuchet catapult, which has a system that consists of ropes, a pulley, and a gear train.
Contrastingly, the research done by Neel and Hardin (2015) emphasizes that it is a siege
catapult from medieval times, which relies on torque applied by twisted ropes. Oxford
Science’s (2016) study expands on this idea and explains that tension is applied to the arm
through a pulling force in the opposite direction of motion, which is caused by a stretched

5

rope. Additionally, Cove Editions (n.d.) states that the launch angle of the projectile could be
changed by moving the cross beam nearer to or further away from the launching arm. In
general, the second design is more commonly accepted as a Mangonel catapult.
Methodology
The requirements for the construction of the catapult were that it must fit in the
dimensions 30cm x 30cm x 30cm, and it should be able to launch the projectile more than
once without collapsing. Also, it needed an attached trigger that did not increase the force
applied to the projectile. Finally, it had to launch a Malteser as far as possible and the
spendings should be low.
In light of this, specific materials were chosen to meet these requirements. First, to
build the catapult shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, popsicle sticks were picked, as they are
sturdier than cardboard and easier to manage, increasing the overall support strength of the
body. Furthermore, elastic bands were used, as they have a high elastic potential energy,
which can make the net force added to the projectile larger. These help achieve longer
distances, which is the project's main objective. Whereas, for the trigger, the best choice
acknowledged was strings, as they are easy to manipulate and do not add any force to the
projectile. Also, hot glue was chosen to join the whole structure as it could withstand the
applied pressure and made the process easier regarding aligning the joints of the frame.
Lastly, a small bottle lid was selected as the catapult bucket, because it would minimalize air
resistance, thus reducing opposing forces. At last, the lid’s walls would prevent the Malteser
from falling out before the launch.
Apart from the materials used, the design chosen is intended to meet the requirements
and achieve long distances. Firstly, the triangular shape facilitates better stability across the
prototype and distributes the forces evenly. Secondly, the original launch angle was 45°, as

6

this is an optimal launch angle for a greater distance to be traveled in a perfect system
(Tsokos, 2014, pg. 50). However, through trial and error, it was found that 70° is the best
launch angle. Additionally, using circular motion, it was deduced that having a long arm
drawn back by a larger angle would lead to a maximized tangential velocity (Tsokos, 2014,
pg. 249). Finally, three rubber bands were added to the structure as a form of adding force in
the direction of the launch. Two were twisted and stretched between the posts of the frame to
serve as a pivot, while the third band was stretched between the main frame and the launch
arm, thus drawing the arm towards the crossbeam.
This design exploits the transformation of energy involved in the launch of a
projectile. Firstly, when the arm is cocked, there is elastic potential energy stored in the
twisted and stretched rubber bands. After the trigger is pulled, there will be potential and
kinetic energy in the arm and the projectile. When the arm hits the crossbeam, some energy is
converted into sound and heat, while the projectile maintains its energy. During the launch,
the projectile experiences potential and kinetic energy, until it hits the ground. This is
considered the end point of the motion observed, however, it is important to emphasize that
when the projectile hits the ground, it will still have kinetic energy, as it carries on moving.
All in all, elastic energy was transformed into kinetic energy to allow the projectile to move
and achieve maximum distances. ￼

Results
The catapult was tested three times, and by filming and observing it, the results presented in
Table 1 could be found. The average distance traveled by the projectile was 4.59 m.
Moreover, the projectile motion was depicted in Figure 3 by using the values from the table
mentioned. Also, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 present free-body diagrams of the
forces acting on the projectile during different stages of the motion.

Discussion
Before the catapult was built, the launch results were predicted. These results were acquired
by assuming that the time it takes the launch arm to complete a full rotation is 0.2s and that
the length of a popsicle stick is around 11.4cm. For the projectile’s motion, the height of the
arm was ignored, therefore the projectile’s vertical displacement is zero and it moves in a
perfect parabolic arc. In addition, air friction (Ff) was ignored. This is because Ff = kv, where
“k” stands for a constant determined by the surface area in contact with the air and “v” is the

10

velocity, and in this case both k and v are very small. All formulas are from Binas (2016) in
sections 35A 1, 2, and 3. The directions of the vectors are indicated in Figure 8.
The initial velocity of the projectile:

𝒗𝑡 =

2𝜋𝑟
𝑇

𝒗𝑡 = 3.581415625 m.s-1
Due to inertia 𝒗𝑡 = 𝒗𝑖 of the projectile so 𝒗𝑖 = 3.581415625 m.s-1
Maximum height reached by the projectile:
At max height 𝒗𝑓 = 0
𝒗𝑓 2 = 𝒗𝑖𝑦 2 + 2𝒂∆𝒚 (Tsokos, 2014, p. 40)
∆𝒚 = 0.326874054 m
Distance travelled by projectile:
Since projectiles move in a parabolic motion with a starting height of 0m, the time it takes the
projectile to land (t2) is double the amount of time it takes to reach maximum height (t1).

After analyzing three different launches, it was concluded that the average distance
travelled by the Malteser was 4.95m, which exceeded the expectations from the thesis. It is
important to emphasize that because of the different conditions between reality and a perfect
system, the mathematical hypothesis differed from the actual results. Additionally, the launch
angle and initial height of the actual project differed from the hypothetical model. The launch
arm was drawn-back to –55°, which is the maximum angle it could be pulled back without
the projectile falling. Even though hypothetically 45° is the best launching angle, as stated
before, launching it from 70° allowed a greater rotation of the arm from the initial position,
which increases the initial velocity. Human error should also be considered since it affects the
exact values of the results.
Overall, all the design factors allowed an increase in force and initial velocity, which
impacted the total distance travelled, making the projectile go further. Through analysis of
the launch, it was concluded that the draw-back angle is the most crucial point to attain the
maximum distances the projectile will reach on the x-axis and y-axis. According to an
experiment made by Science Oxford (2016), the arm’s draw-back angle is the main aspect
that influences the distance travelled and the height reached by the projectile.

12

These results could be even greater; however, some requirements and limitations had
to be met while the catapult was built. One of the limitations was the tension acting in the
catapult. In other words, as the catapult should be able to launch the projectile more than once
without collapsing, the force applied was limited. Moreover, the dimensions of the system are
restricted, which affects the initial height. Also, with constrained time, few attempts could be
made, limiting the improvement of the project by trial and error. Another limitation is that
there is minimal research surrounding catapults built with popsicle sticks, which restricts the
authors’ knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of this design.
Conclusion
Summarily, the design of the catapult manipulated force, energy conserved, and
launch angle to maximize the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile. This distance was
4.95 m. Additionally, it was concluded that the drawback angle of the arm plays a vital role in
the total distance that the projectile can reach by increasing the tension applied by the rubber
bands, since they are being more stretched, and increasing the tangential velocity. It is
recommended, for future analysis, to reconsider building a popsicle stick catapult, since there
is little academic research about it. Furthermore, rubber bands could be added at the top of
the arm to increase the traveled distance. Overall, building and analyzing a catapult leads to
an enriched understanding of engineering studies by applying physics and math formulas to
real-life situations and manipulating numbers to have positive outcomes.

Assume that spring constant of a band is 38.8 N.m-1 (Sunday Academy, 2018, pg3),
that it takes 0.05 seconds for the launch arm to hit the cross-beam (travel 90°) once it is
released, therefore taking 0.2 seconds to complete 1 rotation, the length of a popsicle stick is
around 11.4cm, and that the change in distance for both the twisted and the stretched rubber
band is 22.85cm. For the projectile motion, ignore the height of the arm. Therefore, the
projectile’s vertical displacement is zero and it moves in a perfect parabolic arc. All formulas
are taken from the Binas (2016) in sections 35A 1, 2 and 3. The directions of the vectors are
indicated in Figure 6

𝑭 = 38.8 × 22.85 × 10−2

For the projectile motion, the equation considered must be 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐, since it
represents a parabola.
By applying values from the chart:
For x=0.000: y = c = 0.275
For t = 1.000 s:
0.230 = 𝑎(4.400)2 + 4.400𝑏 + 0.275
For t = 0.2000 s:
1.051 = 𝑎(0.878)2 + 0.878𝑏 + 0.275
Through a piecewise function of both equations, it can be found that a= -0.254, b= 1.106 and,
as stated before, c= 0.275
In the light of these, the final equation of the projectile motion is 𝑦 = 0.254𝑥 2 + 1.106𝑥 +
0.275
